LieWall
-------------

Because the truth will set you free.

Our own words speak against us so many times each day. When I realized this, I wanted to stop doing the same thing I saw others doing and harming themselves. Rather than just keep it to myself though, I wanted to share it with others. The idea for LieWall was born.

I hope to create the site so that people can be encouraged, uplifted, and cheered for. It'd be great if each of us had someone to do that for us in our daily lives, but even those of us who are fortunate enough to have someone like that don't always have them around.

While there are lofty goals for LieWall, step 1 will be to host a working site with a variety of truths over lies.
